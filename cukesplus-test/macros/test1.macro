Given this is a macro definition with "*" in the middle
	Given I run this test
	When this value $1 matches the string (hello) then dance



@Given("^this is a step definition with a very simple second parameter for (.*) in (.*) middle$")
$Any.firstParam $secondParam
	Then it does this step
	And this step
	* this is a step with parameter $firstParam
	Then it does this step with an escaped $$name in the step
