Create CukesPlus project structure.



* Process the regex intelligently by applying any method types to the snippets.



* Set system property "com.replicanet.cukesplus.server.featureEditor" to start the web based feature file editor.
* Add a system property option to produce a HTML report file, in the target directory, of known feature files from the command line arguments.
	Then start ACEServer with that file.
	The report file would contains URLs in the form: demo/autocompletion.html?filename=t1.feature
	This would allow editing of files known to the framework


* Added ACEServerCallback to create the file list html page after a file is saved.
