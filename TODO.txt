* TODO items :)

* Macro feature processing, should not add a comment before "Scenario:" if there are @tags




* Macro feature processing uses a temporary file. Use memory based processing to make it faster




* Editor needs test to create new suite from scratch
	Can be used for other editor tests without altering the main code tests




* Web editor needs tests for line colour highlighting
	Passing
	Unimplemented
	Error
	Skipped



* Editor needs tests for line number execution
* Editor needs tests for file execution
* Editor needs tests for suite execution



* Needs test for adding macro syntax
	* Check adding macro syntax results in new drop down hint
	* Test syntax report generation




* Conditional syntax.
	> Allows the execution state to be set. To allow expansion of conditional syntax.
		See: getAllowRunStep
	> Can output "Skipped"



* Macro expansion, loop
	Can expand properties available at the start of execution




* Use the Cucumber snippet generator to improve the code hints for the web editor
	https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/20db608a5535850139ba25fcdb9be3ae46991855/core/src/main/java/cucumber/runtime/snippets/SnippetGenerator.java
These escape patterns need handling if they don't appear in a capture group: "\\\\" "\\$" "\\(" "\\)" "\\[" "\\]" "\\?" "\\*" "\\+" "\\." "\\^"


* Need to add MSVC compatible error output so the IDE can work with F4 to move to the next build/test error in the feature/macro


* Add a list of potential values that can be used for regex sections (either paramters/capture groups or other regex areas)
	Can bew retrieved from the regex itself or comments in the step definition



* Add pom exec test for command line: --glue TestGlue features
	Use the pom to execute the above command line as part of the test phase and verify the results.



* For ACEServer project write the regex information to "target/gherkin-steps.js" in the following format:
This is to enable the ACE browser editor to pickup changing regex for feature file authoring.
	// Steps that can be used for gherkin
	var simplePotentials = [
	"Given I have a 6502 machine",
	"When I assemble this file *"
	];

	// Note: The indentation for snippets must be tabs not spaces!
	var complexPotentials = "\
	snippet Then the memory at address is value\n\
		Then the memory at ${1:address} is ${2:value}\n\
	";



* Obtain method parameter names http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2237803/can-i-obtain-method-parameter-name-using-java-reflection
** Added com.replicanet.cukesplus.GlueProcessor.getParameterNames(Method method) which uses java.lang.reflect.Parameter.isNamePresent()



* Add a mapping file that schedules tests based on changes from source control.
	Based on source control code changes or referenced JIRAs, automate the selection and prioritization of tests and any dependencies.
	For example of source control changes indicate that source file in certain paths change then map these to execute certain feature files first and/or apply tag filters.
	With realtime report generation this will help indicate significant problems in lengthy continuous integration build and test run cycles.
	Giving more timely reports to developers will help shorten the time between test failure reports and code fixes.



* Spot text areas and tables and output suitable snippets.



* Generate syntax hints or at the very least if they don't exist return back syntax hints with a message telling the user to run once and refresh the page.
